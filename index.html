			Why Tik-Tok is better than Instagram?
			<br>
			<br>
			First of all TT(Tik-Tok) provides an interface and functions that are very easy to work with. It is easier for people to create content even if they don't have any skills in editing videos. Also, TT has free music to use and users can easily put it in there without any problems with copyright. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Another plus of TT is algorithms. TT has different algorithms than Instagram, TT helping young bloggers to earn new subscribers for free. And after your success in Tik-Tok, you can move your subscribers to other platforms like Instagram or youtube. On the other hand on Instagram, algorithms would not allow you to have a big flow of subscribers to your account so, you need to pay a lot of money to other bloggers and Instagram to get new subscribers. 
			<br>
			<br>
			A third big plus is donations on streams. Like on youtube or twich people can send you money during live translations. This gives new bloggers a big motivation to create content and it is always good to get some extra money))

			One of the main features of TT is trends. It is dace, move, challenge, or basically anything that is going viral on this platform. When a new trend is created everybody are filming it but, the main criteria is creativity. So, basically, if you are repeating this trend in the most creative form or you have a good chance of getting a lot of new subscribers.
			<br>
			<br>
			For the last advantage, I will talk about 2 things. The first one is the main audience of Tik-Tok and the second one is the length of the video.
			So, the main audience is children, and to create content that children would love you don't need a big effort. It can be the most primitive jokes or just stupid videos and the shorter and the funnier the video is the better result would be. For example on youtube best length of the video is 10-13min on Instagram is 1min-45sec and on Tik-Tok is 13-8 seconds!!!
			Basically, the author must tell a 10 minutes story in 15-sec max (also you can record 1 min videos but they are not so popular) the author must interest the person and give him emotion (any emotion) in 15 sec! some times it is pretty difficult but, this gives an ability to consume content really fast and people can watch more videos per day. More videos per day-more subscribers and views.
			<br>
			<br>
			So this is why Tik-Tok can be better than Instagram and I think that that is a social media platform of the future just not everybody can accept it. Remember how people were talking about Instagram 10 years ago?

			<h2>Why is Instagram better than Tiktok?</h2>
			<h3> By: Matthew Tenuta </h3>
			<p>
				I believe Instagram is better than tik tok for the following reasons.
				<br>
				<br>
				First, Instagram has more features than tik tok so Instagram will appeal to a bigger audience. Some extra features Instagram has is reels (which is basically instagrams version of tik tok, and it also has IGTV which allows for longer videos than the Instagram feed. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Secondly, Instagram is more popular when it comes to influencer marketing. This means Instagram is a better place to show off your products and sell them to people. With tiktok, people are just there for comedy they don’t care about buying stuff so its got less or a market for selling products.
				<br>
				<br>
				Thirdly, With Instagram, you can post pictures and videos where as with tiktok you can only post videos. This can be a big disadvantage for the people who just want to post pictures or the people who want to see pictures of what people are doing. Overall, I would say Instagram seems more mature than tiktok.
				<br>
				<br>
				Finally, there are a lot of tiktok videos that get put on Instagram making Instagram basically tiktok 2. I don’t really understand why people do this instead of just getting rid of tiktok and just posting them to Instagram in the first place since they are already there. Its like adding a whole other step for actually no reason as all.
				<br>
				<br>
				For these reasons I strongly agree that Instagram is superior and always will be to tiktok.
